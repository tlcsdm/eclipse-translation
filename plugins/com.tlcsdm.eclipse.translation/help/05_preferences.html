    <h1>The OpenExplorer Preference Page</h1>
    
    <p>
      You can configure various preferences to trim OpenExplorer
      to your liking. The preference section can be reached via 
      Window - Preferences - Open Explorer. OpenExplorer 
      has these settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#general">General Options</a>: This is the root node
      of the preference pages for OpenExplorer. It displays information about 
	  the plugin.</li>
      <li><a href="#file_manager">File Manager</a>: 
      Use this page to configure operating system/desktop environment
      specific settings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <a name="general"></a>
    <h2>General Options</h2>
    <p>
	  With the option &quot;Open Explorer&quot; you can view the plugin's 
	  information including version number etc.
    </p>    

    <a name="file_manager"></a>
    <h2>File Manager</h2>
    <p>
      Usually, OpenExplorer auto-detects your operating system and
      your desktop environment. If that does not work for some reason,
      you can use this page to manually select it. You can also use this
      page to configure OpenExplorer if your system is not supported
      out of the box.
    <p>
    <p>
      Each tool can be activated by selecting the radio button next to
      it. Configuration options related to that mode will only be
      enabled if the corresponding mode is selected.
