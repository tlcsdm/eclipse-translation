    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Eclipse plugin provides awesome way to navigate your source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every now and then when working with Eclipse you'd like to examine a file or a 
        folder inside the Eclipse workspace with your file manager or open a shell/cmd.exe
        in this location. Or you edit a file in Eclipse and would like to open the parent
        folder of this file in the file manager or shell. Or the file you are editing
        contains a string which references another file in the filesystem and you would like
        to do some of the things mentioned above with that referenced file. This plug-in
        gives you a convenient way to do all this by adding a few entries to Eclipse's
        context menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        This plug-in is inherently not platform-independent. Currently, the following
        operating systems/desktop environments are supported out of the box:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows</li>
        <li>Mac OS</li>
        <li>Linux with Gnome</li>
        <li>Linux with KDE</li>
        <li>Linux with Xfce</li>
        <li>Linux with LXDE</li>
		<li>Linux with ROX</li>
		<li>Linux with xdg</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, even if your system is not listed there, you can still easily configure 
        OpenExplorer to work correctly on your system.
      </p>
