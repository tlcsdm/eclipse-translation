      <h1>Editors: Context Menu Options for Resources Opened In Editors</h1>
      <p>
      In editors (Java editor, XML editor, text editor, ...) you also can execute OpenExplorer actions,
      just right click anywhere in the editor. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the same options as for resource views like Navigator, Package Explorer or
        Project Explorer, just named a bit different.
