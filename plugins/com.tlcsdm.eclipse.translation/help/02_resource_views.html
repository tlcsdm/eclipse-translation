      <h1>Files and Folders: Context Menu Options for Resources</h1>
      <p>
      In resource views like the Navigator or Package Explorer you can select files
      and folders. OpenExplorer offers the following options here:
      </p>
      <p>
      All options work with a single selected resource as well as with multiple
      resources. If multiple resources are selected and an option only works for 
      files (or only for folders) all resources of the wrong type are ignored
      and the command is executed for the resources it is applicable for.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Show in file manager:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Starts a file manager (depending on your system, this might be the Windows
      Explorer, Finder on Mac OS, Nautilus on Gnome, Konqueror on KDE, Thunar on Xfce
      or PCMan File Manager on LXDE) for the selected resource. If it is a folder, the
      file manager is opened for this folder. If it is a file, the file manager 
      is opened for the parent folder of this file. On some systems (currently on 
      Windows and Mac OS) the file is also selected/highlighted in the file manager.
      If multiple resources are selected, a separate file manager instance is
      opened for each resource.
